        Typically following a General English course, students should be able to understand and communicate on everyday
        subjects such as (depending on their level, of course):
          general greetings
          the weather
          family news and relationships
          general news and current events
          shopping
          telling stories and relating events from the past
          The grammar‏‎ content of General English courses tends to be taught on a “need to know” 
          basis and is likely to cover the grammar needed for everyday conversation.
          
          Often General English courses will include social and cultural elements as needed.
           This happens in classes where, for example, the students will be visiting an English speaking country
            for a holiday where the teacher will include discussions about social etiquette (e.g. queuing, speaking to strangers,
           paying for drinks in a pub as you take them rather than at the end of the evening).

        English grammar is a set of rules that determine the structure of various expressions in the English language,
         such as the structure of words, sentences and phrases. English grammar went through several stages before reaching what it is now.
         The number of letters in the English alphabet is 26 letters.

A sentence in the English language consists of several components: subject, verb, object, complement, and adverb.

And the number of tenses in it is two: the present and the past, and the future tense needs an auxiliary verb to form it.

Word in English language is mainly classified into verb, noun, adjective, adverb, preposition, definite article, pronoun,
 and conjunction. Word order is also very important in a sentence, a phrasal verb may have a compound structure, 
 and there are many expressions for which prepositions are used.
